# STRling Research Intelligence (RI)

### The strategic engine for knowledge-driven pattern discovery and language evolution.

## 1. Overview

Research Intelligence (RI) is the "Think Tank" of the STRling ecosystem. It is a dedicated environment where we "brain-storm" the next architectural requirements for the STRling language.

By utilizing **Inquiry-Based Versioning**, we ensure that every feature added to the STRling core is a direct response to a real-world research necessity.

## 2. The Strategic Loop

We drive the evolution of the **Universal Pattern Engine** through a recursive intelligence cycle:

1. **Ingest**: High-level technical/academic reports are synthesized into `/reports`.
2. **Inquire**: Specific questions regarding pattern representability are tracked in `/inquiries`.
3. **Prototype**: Theoretical pattern structures are validated in `/pattern-libraries`.
4. **Strategize**: Research conclusions are converted into Feature Proposals for the main `strling` repository.

## 3. Repository Structure

### 📂 /reports

**Purpose**: The archive of external research ingestion.
**Substructure**: Organized by **Knowledge Domain**.

- Contains summaries and "Key Takeaways" from papers on genomics, market fragility, AI black-box logic, etc.
- Each report identifies a "Pattern Gap"—a structure that existing RegEx cannot effectively handle.

### 📂 /inquiries

**Purpose**: The central library of strategic inquiries and "What If?" scenarios.
**Substructure**: Organized via **Focus-Based Inquiry Nodes**.

- Folders are named based on the research question (e.g., `inq-probabilistic-genomic-sequencing`).
- Each node contains an `index.md` that synthesizes how the domain's complexity challenges current STRling syntax.

### 📂 /pattern-libraries

**Purpose**: The experimental proving ground for complex data structures.
**Substructure**: Organized via **Recursive Abstraction Layers**.

- This is where the "Master Wielder" techniques are first drafted.
- It maps high-level research (from `/reports`) into concrete STRling code blocks to test for "Wieldability" and "Maintainability."

### 📂 /strategic-alignment

**Purpose**: The bridge between research and the project roadmap.
**Substructure**: Contains Feature Specifications and Roadmap Proposals.

- When an inquiry proves that a new language feature (e.g., fuzzy matching) is required for a domain, the formal proposal is drafted here before being moved to the core `strling` repository.

## 4. Identifying Gaps

The structure is designed to visualize where human knowledge is currently "unwieldable":

- **Intelligence Gaps**: Domains in `/reports` without corresponding `/inquiries`.
- **Representability Gaps**: Inquiries that have identified a pattern we cannot yet represent in `/pattern-libraries`.
- **Architectural Gaps**: Pattern-libraries that prove a concept but lack a corresponding feature in the **STRling Core**.

## 5. Documentation Standards

_**To simplify research report standards, we use Gemini or ChatGPT Deep Research reports.**_

## 6. Research Constraints

Unlimited potential! You can be as creative as you want in proposing new pattern structures. However, all proposals must be grounded in real-world research needs documented in `/reports`.
