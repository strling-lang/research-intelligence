# STRling Research Inquiries: The Intelligence Engine

[← Back to Research Intelligence Hub](../README.md)

## 1. Philosophical Foundation: Representability Abstraction

Research at STRling is not a passive academic exercise; it is an active driver of architectural evolution. We operate on the principle of **Representability Abstraction**. Our mission is to identify "Patterns of the World"—from genomic sequences to socioeconomic trends—and determine if they are "wieldable" within our current framework.

An inquiry is birthed when we identify a **Representability Gap**: a specific structural logic that current pattern technology (RegEx or the STRling Alpha baseline) cannot elegantly describe.

## 2. The Atomic Node Pattern

To eliminate "Information Noise" and "Discovery Friction," STRling-RI utilizes a **Flat-Focus Atomic Node** architecture. Unlike traditional libraries where reports are stored centrally, we co-locate research evidence directly with the inquiry it supports.

### Folder Structure

Each focus folder under `/inquiries/` is a sovereign research node containing:

- **`index.md`**: The synthesis of findings, identifying the "Architectural Delta" (the required change to the STRling Core).
- **`deep-research.md`**: Targeted research reports (often AI-generated "Deep Research" exports) purpose-built for this focus.
- **`evidence/`**: Prototypes, code samples, or data captures that prove the pattern's complexity.

### Benefits of Co-location

- **Auditability**: Every language feature can be traced back to the specific research node that justified its existence.
- **Contextual Integrity**: 100% of the data in a focus folder is relevant to that specific inquiry mission.

## 3. Hybrid Tagging & Flexibility

We reject hierarchical nesting to avoid **Categorization Debt**. Instead, we use a **Metadata Tagging** system within the `index.md` headers to support hybrid focuses. This allows an inquiry to belong to multiple domains simultaneously without physical duplication.

**Standard Domains include:**

- `#safety`: Computational security and ReDoS prevention.
- `#ai`: Symbolic-Neural interfaces and interpretability.
- `#logic`: Semantic validation and standard library taxonomy.
- `#multi-modal`: Non-textual ingestion (Genomics, Telemetry).
- `#ux`: Tooling, LSP projection, and developer ergonomics.

## 4. The Strategic Loop: From "Scout" to "Map"

Every inquiry follows a closed-loop feedback system that ensures research results in code:

1. **Ingest (The Scout)**: Deep research is conducted to explore a domain's complexity.
2. **Inquire**: We ask how STRling's current `Intermediate Representation (IR)` must change to accommodate this complexity.
3. **Prototype**: We draft the "Master Wielder" logic in a pattern library.
4. **Strategize (The Map)**: We propose an **Architectural Delta** (e.g., a new DSL keyword or emitter logic) to the core project.

## 5. Instructional Standards

All new inquiries must be initialized using the `inquiry-index-template.md` and adhere to the `Junior First voice`. We write for smart developers who may be unfamiliar with the theoretical "Master Wielder" principles we are documenting.
